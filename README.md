# Parallel-A*-Project
This is the repository for the final project for the subject of "Parallel Algorithms" on Universidad Nacional de San Agustin (2018). In this project we are focusing on implementing some state of art parallel A* algorithms and evaluting their metrics.

# Root Paper
For this project we based our research on the article "A Survey of Parallel A*" by A. Fukunaga et al. (2017) which is available on ArXiv for free.

# Main Goals
 - To implement a serial version of A*
 - To implement a serial MPI version of A*
 - To implement a shared memory implementation of A*
 - To implement a distributed memory implementation of A*
 - To implement a decentralized version of parallel A*
 - To implement a limited-memory variant of parallel A*
 - Finally to implement a CUDA version of parallel A*

# Team Members
 - Ruben Edwin Hualla Quispe ( Pre-grade 5th year student at UNSA )
 - Patrick Lazo colque ( Pre-grade 4th year student at UNSA)

# Course
 - Parallel Algorithms (COMPUTER SCIENCE - UNSA - 2018)
 - Main Teacher: 

# Final Result
* We hope that the outcome from this project will allow us to write a paper on the parallel computing area. In any case we're attempting to write one for the final presentation of the project.
